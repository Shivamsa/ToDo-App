# 📝 ToDo List Web App

A simple and elegant ToDo List application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and filter the list. It also uses **localStorage** to preserve tasks across sessions.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 🕹️ Mark tasks as completed
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- 🔍 Filter tasks by status: All / Completed / Incomplete
- 💾 Save tasks in browser using localStorage

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivamsa/todo-list.git

📝 Open the Project
Just open the index.html file in your browser.
No server required — it’s a fully frontend app!

🛠 Technologies Used
| Language | Purpose | 
| HTML | Structure | 
| CSS | Styling and layout | 
| JavaScript | Logic and interactivity | 

📁 File Structure
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── style.css          # Styling for the app
└── script.js          # JavaScript logic

🧠 How It Works
- When a task is added via the form, it’s rendered dynamically with options to mark complete or delete.
- Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage to maintain data between page reloads.
- Filtering options allow users to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only active tasks.

🐞 Known Issues
- The Font Awesome icon tags in getLocalTodos() are malformed (fasfa-check-circle) and should be corrected to fas fa-check-circle and fas fa-trash.
- Filtering may not behave correctly if non-element child nodes (like text) exist in todoList.
